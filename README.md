# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System

This project predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting, using machine learning on structured/tabular financial data. It also includes an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and explainability (e.g., SHAP)
- Interactive Streamlit web app for live predictions
- Well-organized codebase with modular structure

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-default-predictor.git
   cd loan-default-predictor
Create and activate virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
streamlit run app.py
📊 Example Use Case
The model processes financial inputs (income, loan amount, credit history, etc.) and returns:

🔴 "Will Default": High risk of non-payment

🟢 "Will Not Default": Low risk, safer to approve

🤝 Credits
Developer: Ali Sleiman
Inspiration: Real-world financial risk modeling systems
